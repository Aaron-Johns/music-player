# music-player
This is just code for the music player.
Most of the instructions are in the code itself.
for youtube_dl to work you need ffmpeg (which I use: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) or avprobe.
The songs and playlists are saved in the subfolders of the destination of the script.
The songs are in the song directory as mp3 (you can change it (Ctrl + H: mp3 to your type)).
The playlists are as text files in the playlist directory.
